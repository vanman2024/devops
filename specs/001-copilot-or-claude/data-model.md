# Data Model: MultiAgent DevOps Solo Founder Integration

## Entities

### Spec
**Purpose**: Represents feature specifications parsed from spec-kit specs.
**Fields**:
- id: string (spec directory name, e.g., "001-user-auth")
- title: string (feature name)
- requirements: list of strings (functional requirements)
- acceptance_criteria: list of strings (from spec.md)
- tasks: list of Task objects

**Relationships**:
- Has many Tasks
- Referenced by QA Report

**Validation Rules**:
- id must match pattern ###-feature-name
- requirements must be non-empty
- acceptance_criteria must be testable

### Task
**Purpose**: Individual actionable items from tasks.md, assigned to agents.
**Fields**:
- id: string (T001, T002, etc.)
- description: string (task description)
- assigned_agent: string (@copilot, @claude, etc.)
- status: enum (pending, in_progress, completed)
- dependencies: list of task ids

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to Spec
- Assigned to Agent Swarm

**Validation Rules**:
- assigned_agent must be valid @symbol
- dependencies must exist in same spec

### Agent Swarm
**Purpose**: Group of AI agents working in parallel on tasks.
**Fields**:
- id: string (unique swarm identifier)
- agents: list of strings (agent names)
- tasks: list of Task objects
- status: enum (deployed, running, completed)
- logs: list of log entries

**Relationships**:
- Has many Tasks
- Generates QA Reports

**Validation Rules**:
- agents must be non-empty
- tasks must be assigned to agents in swarm

### Deployment Plan
**Purpose**: Configuration for CI/CD and deployment targets.
**Fields**:
- target: enum (docker, azure, aws, script)
- environment: enum (dev, staging, prod)
- config: dict (target-specific settings)
- rollback_enabled: boolean

**Relationships**:
- Generated from Spec
- Used by Deployment Process

**Validation Rules**:
- target must be supported
- config must match target schema

### QA Report
**Purpose**: Output of quality checks and validations.
**Fields**:
- spec_id: string (linked spec)
- tests_passed: integer
- tests_failed: integer
- security_issues: list of strings
- performance_metrics: dict
- compliance_status: boolean

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to Spec
- Generated by QA Process

**Validation Rules**:
- spec_id must exist
- compliance_status must be true for deployment

## State Transitions

### Task Lifecycle
- pending → in_progress (when agent starts)
- in_progress → completed (when agent finishes)
- completed (terminal state)

### Agent Swarm Lifecycle
- deployed → running (when tasks start)
- running → completed (when all tasks complete)

### Deployment Lifecycle
- planned → deploying → deployed
- deployed → rolling_back → rolled_back (on failure)

## Data Flow
1. Spec parsed from spec.md/tasks.md
2. Tasks assigned to agents in swarm
3. Swarm executes tasks, generates reports
4. QA validates against spec acceptance criteria
5. Deployment plan executed if QA passes
