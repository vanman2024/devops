# Feature Specification: MultiAgent DevOps Solo Founder Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-multiagent-devops-solo-founder-integration`  
**Created**: September 23, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "@copilot (or @claude, @gemini, etc.) - As a fast development specialist, help me build out the multiagent-devops component to fully support the solo founder approach from the SOLO_FOUNDER_GUIDE.md. The goal is to create a streamlined DevOps pipeline that integrates with the "Spec -> Install -> Coordinate" workflow, enabling solo founders to rapidly prototype, test, and deploy applications using AI agents.

Key Requirements:
1. **Spec Integration**: Enhance the devops CLI to automatically read and parse spec-kit specs (from specs/*/tasks.md) and generate deployment plans, CI/CD pipelines, and quality checks based on the feature requirements.

2. **Install Automation**: Add smart dependency management that detects the project stack (e.g., Python, Node.js, Docker) and installs only necessary components (e.g., multiagent-devops, multiagent-testing) without vendor lock-in. Include one-click setup for common frameworks like Next.js, Django, or FastAPI.

3. **Coordinate Workflow**: Implement agent orchestration features where the devops CLI can deploy "agent swarms" (using multiagent-agentswarm) to parallelize tasks from tasks.md. Support real-time monitoring of agent progress via logs, and provide integration hooks for AI CLIs (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.) to coordinate builds, tests, and deployments.

4. **Quality Assurance (QA) Enhancements**: Expand the `ops qa` command to include automated testing, security scans, performance monitoring, and code quality checks. Make it spec-driven so it validates against acceptance criteria in spec.md.

5. **Deployment Automation**: Add support for multiple deployment targets (local Docker, cloud providers like Azure/AWS, or simple production scripts). Include rollback capabilities and environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod).

6. **Solo Founder UX**: Prioritize simplicity and speed - commands should be intuitive for non-experts, with clear feedback and error handling. Include a "founder mode" that guides users through the workflow with prompts and suggestions.

Implementation Plan:
- Start by analyzing the current multiagent-devops structure in src/multiagent_devops/ops/.
- Add new commands like `ops spec-init`, `ops swarm-deploy`, and `ops deploy-plan`.
- Integrate with spec-kit for spec parsing and task assignment.
- Use Python for core logic, with shell scripts for deployment.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Linux/macOS/WSL).
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Test with a sample spec from the guide (e.g., user authentication feature).

Deliverables:
- Updated CLI commands in src/multiagent_devops/ops/commands/.
- New scripts for agent coordination and deployment.
- Documentation updates in README.md explaining the solo founder workflow.
- A simple test case demonstrating the full "Spec -> Install -> Coordinate" cycle.

Focus on production-ready code with security best practices, and make it fast to implement for rapid iteration. Commit changes with semantic messages like "feat: add spec-driven QA and swarm deployment to devops CLI.""

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors (solo founders), actions (build out devops, integrate workflow), data (specs, tasks), constraints (speed, simplicity)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a solo founder using AI agents for development, I want the multiagent-devops component to be enhanced so that I can seamlessly integrate it with the "Spec -> Install -> Coordinate" workflow, allowing me to rapidly prototype, test, and deploy applications without deep DevOps expertise.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a solo founder has a spec-kit spec with tasks, **When** they run `ops spec-init`, **Then** the devops CLI automatically parses the spec and generates a deployment plan.
2. **Given** a project with an unknown stack, **When** the founder runs install automation, **Then** the system detects the stack and installs only necessary components without lock-in.
3. **Given** tasks.md with agent assignments, **When** the founder runs `ops swarm-deploy`, **Then** agent swarms are deployed to parallelize tasks with real-time monitoring.
4. **Given** a feature spec, **When** the founder runs `ops qa`, **Then** automated testing, security scans, and performance checks validate against acceptance criteria.
5. **Given** a completed feature, **When** the founder chooses a deployment target, **Then** the system deploys with rollback capabilities and environment configs.
6. **Given** a non-expert user, **When** they enter "founder mode", **Then** the CLI provides guided prompts and intuitive commands with clear feedback.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the spec file is malformed or missing?
- How does the system handle unsupported project stacks?
- What if agent swarms fail during coordination?
- How are security vulnerabilities reported in QA?
- What happens during deployment failures, and how is rollback triggered?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze specs to automatically discover and install required components based on content analysis (auth→multiagent-auth, payments→multiagent-payments).
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement smart agent routing that assigns tasks to agents based on capability matrix (backend→@copilot, UI→@codex, architecture→@claude).
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide progressive enhancement modes (prototype→MVP→production→scale) with appropriate component and agent allocation.
- **FR-004**: System MUST create unified monitoring dashboard showing specs, agents, components, deployments, and QA status in single view.
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement self-healing pipeline that auto-fixes test failures, dependency conflicts, and performance issues.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support spec-driven development where specs determine components, agents self-organize, and system self-configures.
- **FR-007**: System MUST expand `ops qa` to include automated testing, security scans, performance monitoring with spec validation.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support multiple deployment targets with rollback and environment-specific configurations.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide intuitive CLI for non-experts with guided founder mode and clear feedback.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Spec**: Represents feature specifications, including tasks and acceptance criteria.
- **Task**: Individual actionable items assigned to agents, with dependencies and priorities.
- **Agent Swarm**: Group of AI agents working in parallel on tasks.
- **Deployment Plan**: Generated configuration for CI/CD and deployment targets.
- **QA Report**: Output of quality checks, including test results and security scans.
